## What components make up ThreatVision?

### Threat Scan
Threat Scan is an unlimited on-demand point in time vulnerability scan that can be initiated across a solution via MyUKFast, which detects any components that require patching, updating or configuration that needs changing to ensure security. Potential issues are also highlighted with a severity score allowing the client to tailor their remediation efforts to the most critical threats. Once completed, a detailed online report will be generated, clearly defining any vulnerabilities or just containing the top vulnerabilities found in that scan. Schedules can be configured to initiate a scan on a regular basis to ensure a solution is kept as secure as possible with ever changing threats and vulnerabilities.

### Threat Surveillance
Threat Surveillance is an agent based intrusion detection/prevention system, which continually monitors numerous aspects of servers/VMs within a solution to detect suspicious activity. If said activity is detected an alert will be generated and all information will be sent to the client. When Threat Surveillance is purchased, Threat Scan is also included.

### Threat SOC (Security Operations Centre)
Threat SOC is an additional product which can be bolted onto Threat Surveillance. Clients still recieve all the features of Threat Surveillance; however, they can also leverage specialist managed support from our Security Operation Centre. The SOC team will pro-actively look into alerts received from Threat Surveillance and apply any remediations if required.
